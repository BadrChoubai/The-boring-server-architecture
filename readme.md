# The boring server architecture

## What we will cover

* What is the boring server architecture?
* Why is it boring?
* Why is this such a popular architecture?
* When do you use it?

## Notes

The project I will show you is an example of the most common
server side architecture I know of.

This is the general structure of every big project I have worked
on and it was the architecture I was taught in school by working
professionals who moonlighted as instructors.

It is by far the architecture I see most companies use.

This architecture is a beginners best bet to learn a way of working
that will let them build their own company and work at most
large companies.
